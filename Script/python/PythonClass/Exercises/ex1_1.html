<p>
<b>(a) Using Python as a Calculator</b>

<p>
On your machine, start IDLE and use Python to solve the following problem.

<p>
Lucky Larry bought 75 shares of Google stock at a price of $235.14
per share.  Today, shares of Google are priced at $711.25.  Using
Python's interactive mode as a calculator, figure out how much profit
Larry would make if he sold all of his shares.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>(711.25 - 235.14) * 75</b>
35708.25
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Pro-tip:  Use the underscore (_) variable to use the result of the
last calculation.  For example, how much profit does Larry make after
his evil broker takes their 20% cut?
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>_ * 0.80</b>
28566.600000000002
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>(b) Getting help</b>

<p>
Use the <tt>help()</tt> command to get help on the <tt>abs()</tt> function.  Then use <tt>help()</tt> to
get help on the <tt>round()</tt> function.   Type <tt>help()</tt> just by itself with no value to enter the
interactive help viewer.</p>

<p>
One caution with <tt>help()</tt> is that it doesn't work for basic Python statements such as <tt>print</tt>,
<tt>for</tt>, <tt>if</tt>, <tt>while</tt>, and so forth (i.e., if you type <tt>help(print)</tt> you'll
get a syntax error). Sadly, there is no other option than to read the notes or a Python book for further information
here.</p>

<p>
Followup: Go to <a
href="http://docs.python.org">http://docs.python.org</a> and find the
documentation for the <tt>abs()</tt> function (hint: it's found under the
library reference related to built-in functions).</p>

<p>
<b>(c) Cutting and Pasting</b>

<p>
For parts of this class, you will be required to cut and paste
interactive code samples from the exercise page to the IDLE
interactive session.  To do this, you must select code starting after
the <tt>>>></tt> prompt and going up to, but not any further than the
first blank line or the next <tt>>>></tt> prompt (whichever appears first). In the exercises,
this text is always bold-face.  Select "copy" from the brower, go
to the IDLE window, and select "paste" to copy it into the Python
shell.   To get the code to run, you may have to hit "Return" once after you've
pasted it in.

<P>
Use cut-and-paste to execute the Python statements in this session:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>12 + 20</b>
32
>>> <b>(3 + 4
          + 5 + 6)</b>
18
>>> <b>for i in range(5):
        print i</b>

0
1
2
3
4
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<P>
<b>Warning:</b> It is <em>never</em> possible to paste more than one Python command (statements that
appear after <tt>>>></tt>) to the Python shell at a time.  You have to paste each command one at a time.

<P>
<b>Tip:</b> Use keyboard shortcuts for cut and paste. On Windows, use Ctrl-C to copy, and Ctrl-V to paste.   On the
Mac, use Command-C to copy and Command-V to paste.

<p>
<b>(d) Where is My Bus?</b>

<p>If you've made it this far and are waiting for others to catch up, type these
statements to find out how long people waiting on the corner of Clark
street and Balmoral in Chicago will have to wait for the next
northbound CTA #22 bus:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>import urllib</b>
>>> <b>from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse</b>
>>> <b>u = urllib.urlopen("http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/map/getStopPredictions.jsp?stop=14791&route=22")</b>
>>> <b>doc = parse(u)</b>
>>> <b>for pt in doc.findall(".//pt"):
         print pt.text</b>

6 MIN
18 MIN
28 MIN
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, you just downloaded a web page, parsed an XML document, and extracted some useful information in about 6 lines of code.
Try it again and watch the predictions change. If you can't get the above statements to work, check to make
sure your internet connection is working. </p>
