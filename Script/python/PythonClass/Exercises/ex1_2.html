<b>(a) The Bouncing Ball</b>

<p>
A rubber ball is dropped from a height of 100 meters and each time it
hits the ground, it bounces back up to 3/5 the height it fell.  Write
a program "bounce.py" that prints a table showing the height of the
first 10 bounces.</p>

<p>
Your program should make a table that looks something like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
1 60.0
2 36.0
3 21.6
4 12.96
5 7.776
6 4.6656
7 2.79936
8 1.679616
9 1.0077696
10 0.60466176
</pre>
</blockquote>

<P>
<b>(b) Cutting and Pasting</b>

<P>
The following code fragment contains code from the Sears tower problem in the notes.

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><td><pre>
# sears.py                                                                                                                                                             

bill_thickness = 0.11 * 0.001    # Meters (0.11 mm)                                                                                                                    
sears_height   = 442             # Height (meters)
num_bills      = 1
day            = 1

while num_bills * bill_thickness < sears_height:
    print day, num_bills, num_bills * bill_thickness
    day = days + 1
    num_bills = num_bills * 2

print "Number of days", day
print "Number of bills", num_bills
print "Final height", num_bills * bill_thickness
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Using IDLE, open a new editing window by selecting the "File > New" menu option.   Copy and paste the
code that appears above into this editing Window.  Save the code as a program <tt>sears.py</tt>. Run
the code by selecting the "Run > Run Module" menu option.   Note, when you run the code you
will get an error message. See the next section.

<P>
<b>(c) Basic Debugging</b>

<P>
In the <tt>sears.py</tt> program, there is a minor typo which causes the program to crash
with an error message such as this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sears.py", line 10, in &lt;module>
    day = days + 1
NameError: name 'days' is not defined
</pre>
</blockquote>

In IDLE, move the cursor to the line that shows the file and line number and
right click on it.  An option to take you to that exact location in the program will appear.
Follow it, fix the bug, and re-run the program.
