<b>(a) Dave's Mortgage</b>
</p>

<p>
Dave has decided to take out a $500,000 mortgage with Guido's
Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Viagra trading corporation.  Unbelievably,
he got an unbelievable interest rate of only 4% and an initial monthly
payment of $499.  However, Guido, being somewhat sneaky didn't tell
Dave that after 2 years, the interest rate would change to 9% and the
monthly payment would become $3999.  Write a Python program that
figures out how many months it will take Dave to pay off this loan and
how much it will actually cost.

<p>
To solve this problem, start by setting variables for the principal,rate, and payment:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table><tr><td>
<pre>
principal = 500000.00    # Mortgage amount
rate = 0.04              # Interest rate
payment = 499            # Monthly payment
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

<p>After each month, the principal will be adjusted by the following
amount:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
principal = principal*(1+rate/12) - payment
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
At 24 months, you'll need to change the rate and payment.  The output
should look something like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Total months 677
Total paid 2623323.0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>(b) Make a table</b>
</p>

<p>
Modify the program to print out a table showing the month, total paid
so far, and the remaining principal.  The output should look something
like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
1 499.0 501167.666667
2 998.0 502339.225556
3 1497.0 503514.689641
4 1996.0 504694.07194
5 2495.0 505877.385513
...
675 2615325.0 5167.59241717
676 2619324.0 1207.3493603
677 2623323.0 -2782.5955195
Total months 677
Total paid 2623323.0
</pre>
</blockquote>
