<b>Caution:</b>

<p>
In exercises where you are supposed to interact with the interpreter,
<tt>>>></tt> is the interpreter prompt that you get when Python wants
you to type a new statement.  Some statements in the exercise span
multiple lines--to get these statements to run, you may have to hit
'return' a few times.  Just a reminder that you <b>DO NOT</b> type
the <tt>>>></tt> when working these examples.

<p>
In this exercise, we experiment with operations on Python's string type.  You may want to do most of this exercise
at the Python interactive prompt where you can easily see the results.

<p>
Define a string containing a series of stock ticker symbols like this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>symbols = 'AAPL IBM MSFT YHOO SCO'</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Now, let's experiment with different string operations:

<p>
<b>(a) Extracting individual characters and substrings</b>

<p>Strings are arrays of characters.  Try extracting a few characters:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols[0]</b>
'A'
>>> <b>symbols[1]</b>
'A'
>>> <b>symbols[2]</b>
'P'
>>> <b>symbols[-1]</b>        # Last character
'O'
>>> <b>symbols[-2]</b>        # Negative indices are from end of string
'C'
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you want, you can process strings character by character as an array.   Try it
out by typing in the following statements which scan <tt>symbols</tt> until the
the first space is found and stops:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>i = 0</b>
>>> <b>while i &lt; len(symbols):</b>
          <b>if symbols[i] == ' ':
                break</b>     # Terminates the loop early
          <b>i = i + 1</b>
   
>>> <b>i</b>
4
>>> <b>print symbols[0:i]</b>
AAPL
>>> <b>print symbols[:i]</b>  # first index is optional (defaults to beginning)
AAPL
>>> <b>print symbols[i:]</b>  # last index is option (defaults to end)
 IBM MSFT YHOO SCO
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just a friendly reminder.... if you are cutting and pasting commands into IDLE, you will
need to copy each statement that appears after <tt>>>></tt> individually.
<p>
Note: the <tt>break</tt> statement in the above code is how you get out of a loop early.

<P>
<b>(b) Strings as read-only objects</b>

<p>
In Python, strings are read-only.   Verify this by trying to change the first character of <tt>symbols</tt> to a lower-case 'a'. 

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols[0] = 'a'</b>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
>>> 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>(c) String concatenation</b>

<p>
Although string data is read-only, you can always reassign a variable to a newly created string.   
Try the following statement which concatenates a new symbol "GOOG" to the end of <tt>symbols</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols = symbols + 'GOOG'</b>             
>>> <b>symbols</b>
'AAPL IBM MSFT YHOO SCOGOOG'
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<P>
Oops!  That's not what we wanted.  Let's fix it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols = symbols[:-4]</b>        # All but last 4 chars
>>> <b>symbols</b>
'AAPL IBM MSFT YHOO SCO'
>>> <b>symbols = symbols + ' GOOG'</b>   # Note the extra space
>>> <b>symbols</b>
'AAPL IBM MSFT YHOO SCO GOOG'
>>> 
</pre>
</blockquote>

Now, try adding "HPQ" to the beginning of <tt>symbols</tt> like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols = 'HPQ ' + symbols</b>     
>>> <b>symbols</b>
... look at the result ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

It should be noted in both of these examples, the original string <tt>symbols</tt> is <em>NOT</em>
being modified "in place" (i.e., modifications don't overwrite the
memory currently being used to to store the string contents).   Instead, a completely new string is created.  The variable name <tt>symbols</tt> is
just reassigned to the new value.  Afterwards, the old string is destroyed since it's not being used anymore.

<p>
<b>(d) Membership testing (substring testing)</b>

<p>
Experiment with the <tt>in</tt> operator to check for substrings.  At
the interactive prompt, try these operations:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>'IBM' in symbols</b>
True
>>> <b>'AA' in symbols</b>
True
>>> <b>'CAT' in symbols</b>
False
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Make sure you understand why the check for "AA" returned <tt>True</tt>.

<p>
<b>(e) String Methods</b>

<p>
At the Python interactive prompt, try experimenting with some of the
string methods. 

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols.lower()</b>
'hpq aapl ibm msft yhoo sco goog'
>>> <b>symbols</b>       
'HPQ AAPL IBM MSFT YHOO SCO GOOG'
</pre>
</blockquote>

Remember, strings are always read-only.  If you want to save the result of an operation, you
need to place it in a variable:

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>lowersyms = symbols.lower()</b>
>>> <b>lowersyms</b>
'hpq aapl ibm msft yhoo sco goog'
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Try some more operations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
>>> <b>symbols.find('MSFT')</b>
13
>>> <b>symbols[13:17]</b>
'MSFT'
>>> <b>symbols = symbols.replace('SCO','')</b>
>>> <b>symbols</b>
'HPQ AAPL IBM MSFT YHOO  GOOG'
>>> <b>for c in symbols:</b>
        <b>print 'c =', c</b>

(look at the result)
>>>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
By the way, the <tt>for</tt> statement is what Python uses to iterate
over the contents of something.  In the case of a string, it iterates
over the individual letters--one at a time.
