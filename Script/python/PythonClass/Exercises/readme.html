<h1>Introduction to the Exercises</h1>

Most of the exercises in this class are based on a relatively simple
problem area---that of working with stock market data.  This problem
area has been chosen for a number of reasons:

<ul>
<li>It is a relatively simple concept.
<li>It involves various aspects of data processing and data analysis.
<li>It naturally lends itself to looking at different aspects of data representation, objects, and relationships between objects.
<li>It has ties to different areas of systems programming--for instance, how to deal with real-time streaming stock quotes.
<li>It can be used as basis for various internet programming applications.
<li>It extends naturally into other problem domains including numerical programming, databases, graphical user interfaces, and performance tuning.
</ul>

There are a few general themes that run throughout the exerices.

<ul>
<Li>Different techniques for representing data.  You will see different formulations of data structures, objects, and 
relationships between objects.  A major goal of the exercises is for you to see many different approaches and for you
to explore their tradeoffs.

<p>
<li>Different ways of organizing programs. You will see the same problem solved in many different ways throughout 
the class.  Again, the goal is to explore different approaches and their tradeoffs.

<p>
<li>Solving problems in a ways that are portable, reliable, and efficient.   Almost all of the exercises are
cross platform (Windows/Unix).   In addition, the exercises should work with any standard Python installation without the
need for third party modules.
</ul>

Almost every exercise has solution code that can be copied, modified, and studied.   It is important to emphasize that
certain exercises are more difficult than others and that there is only a limited amount of time to work each problem.  Thus,
you should not feel pressure to come up with your own solution to every single problem.  Please look at the solutions as a guide and
play around with them. 

<p>
<b>Critical Note:</b> Many of the exercises in this class build upon
previous exercises as you go along.  If you have to step out of the
class for a period or get stuck, please catch up by simply copying the
posted solution code (look for the "Solution" link at the bottom of each page).
