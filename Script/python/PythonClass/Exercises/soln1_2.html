<h1>Exercise 1.2 - Solution</h1>

<P>
<b>(a) The Bouncing Ball</b>

<pre>
# bounce.py
height = 100
bounce = 1
while bounce &lt;= 10:
    height = height * (3.0/5)
    print bounce, height
    bounce += 1
</pre>

<b>Commentary</b>

<p>
This example illustrates one potential pitfall with mathematical
calculations in Python---truncation of integer division.  For example,
if you use (3/5) instead of (3.0/5) above, you will find that the
calculation is meaningless as 3/5 evaluates to 0.  This behavior
of division is considered to be one of the largest design warts in Python and
is being changed in Python 3.
