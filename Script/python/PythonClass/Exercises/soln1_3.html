<b>Commentary</b>

<p>
After your program has finished executing, notice how all of the variables defined in your program are still alive in
the interpreter.   For instance, you can calculate the number of years by typing this statement:

<pre>
>>> <b>months/12.0</b>
56.416666666666664
>>>
</pre>

<p>
<b>Tip:</b> If you are running Python from a shell such as the Unix shell, use <tt>python -i <em>scriptname.py</em></tt>
to have the interpreter enter interactive mode after program execution.
