<h1>Exercise 8.3 - Solution</h1>

<b>(a) Setting up a processing pipeline</b>

<pre>
# follow.py

import time
import os

def follow(thefile):
    '''
    Generator that produces a sequence of lines being written at the end of a file.
    '''
    # Move the file pointer to the end of the file
    thefile.seek(0,os.SEEK_END)

    # Repeatedly try to read and emit lines
    while True:
        line = thefile.readline()
        if line == '':
            # No data available. Try again shortly
            time.sleep(0.1)
            continue
        yield line

def splitter(lines):
    '''
    Split a sequence of lines containing CSV data into a sequence of rows.
    '''
    for line in lines:
        yield line.split(',')

# Sample code for following the real-time log
if __name__ == '__main__':
    f = open("Data/stocklog.dat")
    lines = follow(f)
    rows = splitter(lines)
    for r in rows:
        print r

<b>(b) Making more pipeline components</b>

def splitter(lines):
    '''
    Split a sequence of lines containing CSV data into a sequence of rows.
    '''
    for line in lines:
        yield line.split(',')

def make_records(rows,names):
    '''
    Turn a sequence of rows into a sequence of dictionaries.
    '''
    for row in rows:
        yield dict(zip(names,row))

# Sample use
if __name__ == '__main__':
