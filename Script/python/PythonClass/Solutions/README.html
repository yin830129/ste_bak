<h1>Introduction to Python</h1>

<p>
The <tt>Solutions</tt> folder contains complete solution code
for most of the class exercises.  You should only use this code
if you are completely stuck, didn't have enough time to finish
one of the exercises, or are simply too worn out to type any further!

<p>
To use this solution code, go to the appropriate directory for the
exercise in question (for example, <tt>5_2/</tt> for Exercise 5.2).
Select <b>ALL</b> of the files in that directory and copy them
to the top-level <tt>PythonClass</tt> folder.  This copy process
should restore all of the class files to some kind of working
state needed for the exercise at hand.

<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> Copying solution code may overwrite any files
that you have created yourself.  If you want to save your own
work, make sure you make a backup first.
