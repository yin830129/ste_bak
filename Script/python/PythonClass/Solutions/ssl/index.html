<h1>Advanced Networking Examples</h1>

<p>
This directory contains some sample code related to SSL handshaking
between different machines using different protocols and libraries.
Please consult <a
href="http://docs.python.org/library/ssl">http://docs.python.org/library/ssl</a>
for important information concerning these examples.
</p>

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<P>
To do any kind of work with SSL you first need to have a set of
public/private keypairs and a set of certificates.  Generating the
keys and certificates are outside the scope of Python.  Consult
documentation for OpenSSL or related package for more information.
</p>
<p>
For these examples, a set of keys and certificates have been made
already:
</p>

<ul>

  <p>
  <li>The <tt>privkeys/</tt> directory contains three private keys for "acme",
  "guido", and "larry".</li></p>
  <p>
  <li>The <tt>certs/</tt> directory contains three signed certificates for
  "acme", "guido", and "larry".</li>
  </p>
  <P>
  <li>The <tt>ca/</tt> directory contains information about the root
  certificate authority used to sign the certificates.  The file
  <tt>ca/ca.crt</tt> is the certificate for the certificate authority.
  </li>
  </p>
</ul>

<h3>Example 1 : A Simple SSL Server/Client</h3>

<p>
An example of an SSL server that presents a signed certificate to
clients.  The client code verifies the server identity using the
certificate authority (CA) certificate.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="ssl_server1.py"><tt>ssl_server1.py</tt></a></li>
  <li><a href="ssl_client1.py"><tt>ssl_client1.py</tt></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 2 : A SSL Server/Client with paired certificates</h3>

<p>
An example of an SSL server that requires clients to present
certificates that are verified against a trusted certificate
authority.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="ssl_server2.py"><tt>ssl_server2.py</tt></a></li>
  <li><a href="ssl_client2.py"><tt>ssl_client2.py</tt></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 3 : An SSL XML-RPC Server with paired certificates</h3>

<p>
An example of creating an XML-RPC server that uses SSL and requires
clients to present certificates signed by a trusted certificate
authority.
</p>


<ul>
  <li><a href="ssl_xmlrpc_server.py"><tt>ssl_xmlrpc_server.py</tt></a></li>
  <li><a href="ssl_xmlrpc_client.py"><tt>ssl_xmlrpc_client.py</tt></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 4: An SSL Web Server with paired certificates</h3>

<p>
An example of creating an HTTP server that uses SSL as well as using
<tt>urllib2</tt> to provide client certificates.
</p>


<ul>
  <li><a href="ssl_http_server.py"><tt>ssl_http_serv.py</tt></a></li>
  <li><a href="ssl_urllib.py"><tt>ssl_urllib.py</tt></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you try to connect to this server using a normal web browser at <a
href="https://localhost:8080">https://localhost:8080</a>, you should
get an error message rejecting the connection due to bad
certicates. The only to connect is to present a certificate as shown
in the <tt>ssl_urllib.py</tt> code.</p>
